## WARNING: IN DEVELOPMENT
There are still a lot of compile errors and stuff, so this version isnt copy and paste ready. All the logic is there though, so any issues should be pretty easy to fix.
this is NOT the case with PIDController class, as it is being actively fixed and worked on, so if you have your own autonomous movemnt code you can replace that here, or fix it yourself as its taking me a while to get to it. Good luck!
