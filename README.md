# MRILib

**Modular Robotics Infrastructure Library** for FTC  
A flexible, powerful Java library for creating clean, abstracted, and reusable robot code for TeleOp and Autonomous modes in FTC.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

MRILib is a modular codebase for FTC robots that enables rapid development, clean structure, and advanced functionality without boilerplate.

It provides:

- A layered robot class system (`Bot`, `ArmBot`, `AutoBot`) to manage all subsystems
- Extensible state machines for both autonomous and TeleOp
- A refined `DebouncedGamepad` for smooth, safe input handling
- Advanced PID-based motion control using `PIDController`
- Clean abstractions for drive control, arms, and sensor integrations

## ðŸ“¦ Library Structure

### ðŸ”§ Robot Management Classes (`managers/`)
- `Bot`: Base class for drivetrain and odometry
- `ArmBot`: Extends `Bot` with pivot, slide, and claw components
- `AutoBot`: Extends `ArmBot` with vision and sensor processing
- These classes encapsulate both **initialization** and **processing** logic for their respective subsystems.

### ðŸ¤– State Machines
- `DriveFSM`: Controls sequential drive tasks during Autonomous
- `ArmFSM`: Manages states of the arm during both TeleOp and Auto
- `BotState`: Base class for state machine steps
- Includes private subclassing of `BotState` in `ArmFSM` for encapsulated arm logic

### ðŸ§  Motion Control (`motion/`)
- `PIDCoefficients`: Simple container for P, I, D values
- `PIDController`: 2D motion profiling with `x`, `y`, and `theta` components
- Used by `DriveFSM` to execute smooth, accurate motion steps

### ðŸŽ® Input Utilities (`util/`)
- `DebouncedGamepad`: Drop-in replacement for FTCâ€™s Gamepad that handles input edge detection cleanly
- Simplifies toggles and conditional actions in TeleOp

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- Modular robot building through layered base classes
- Autonomous drive control via FSM and PID
- Reliable arm and claw state management
- Gamepad debouncing for edge-triggered control
- Readable, minimal syntax for adding conditions and actions
